<p>With over 9 years of experience in software testing and automation, I am currently an expert SDET4 at Instawork, a
  leading platform for matching hospitality workers with flexible jobs. I am responsible for designing, developing, and
  executing automated tests for web, mobile, and API applications, using cutting-edge tools and frameworks such as
  Nightwatch, Cypress, Rest Assured, and Gatling. I also manage the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, CircleCI, and Docker,
  ensuring fast and reliable delivery of quality products.</p>

<p>As an ISTQB certified tester and an Oracle certified Java SE6 programmer, I have a strong background in OOPs
  concepts, scripting languages, and cloud platforms. I have successfully migrated automated tests from Selenium to
  Cypress, achieving more than 90% coverage, and automated UI and API test cases using Java-based core automation
  framework, achieving more than 95% and 100% coverage respectively. Additionally, I have performed performance testing
  using Gatling tool and reported the release criteria information to the business team.</p>

<p>I am always exploring new technologies to improve existing processes and collaborating with my team to deliver the
  best solutions for our clients. You can learn more about my professional journey and connect with me on <a
